# WebUI

## Architecture

- The User Interface talks to the Backend via API. See
  [API Documentation](api.md)
- The Web Ui is build with [Sveltekit](https://svelte.dev/)

## User Roles

Currently the User interface has no Authentication added. In a
[Server installation](../install/server.md) we installed two password protected
users: (see `nginx` folder)

- `reader`: can only view the page
- `editor`: can add annotation on the media player page

You also have these roles in other installation mode, by just going on the
routes:

- `/edit`: is the route for the `editor` role
- `/`: switches to the reader role.

## Homepage Editor

![Search interface](static/content/editor-homepage.png){ width="800",
caption="hello" } /// caption Homepage of the Editor User available at `/edit`
///

## Homepage Reader

![Search interface](static/content/reader-homepage.png){ width="800",
caption="hello" } /// caption Homepage of the Reader User available at `/` ///

## Search Page

![Search interface](static/content/search-interface.png){ width="800",
caption="hello" } /// caption Search interface to make speaker statements
searchable available at `/search` ///

## Mediaplayer Page as Editor

![Search interface](static/content/mediaplayer-editor.png){ width="800",
caption="hello" } /// caption Media player detail page for the reader user to
compare transcripts and translations ///

## Mediaplayer Page as Reader

![Search interface](static/content/mediaplayer-interface.png){ width="800" } ///
caption Media player detail page for the Editor user: the editor user can
correct the transcripts and translations and add speaker name and Role ///
